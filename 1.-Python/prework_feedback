Hi Kevin! 🙋‍♂‍ Here I send you some feedback about your prework 😀 

First of all, I want to congratulate you. You did a really good job with the prework. 

On the following lines I will send you some feedback about the prework exercises. Most of the are not about mistakes, they are proposals in case you would like to make changes in your code.

1 - Snail-and-Well

Bonus: In this case, on the fifth day the snail reaches the 125cm, so if you would have counted 5 using snail_position >= 125 would have also been correct.

The rest is all good 😀 

2 - Duel-of-Sorcerers

In the first exercise you could use the spells variable to save the length of the spells `spells = len(gandalf)`, and use it it as the range in the third exercise. 

I have nothing else to add. 

3 - Bus

All good in these exercises too 😀 

4 - Robin-Hood 

This one is also perfect. As a suggestion, in the last exeercise you could add an empty list to store the points of the arrows that would lie outside the radius of 9. 

5 - Temperature-Processor

It is nice that you already have experience with libraries such Scipy to use the interpolate function. 

In the first exercise of the bonus, there is no need for the 0 in the range (inside the list comprehension), and also the = sign before the 70 can be deleted. 

The rest is perfect. 

6 - Rock-Paper-Scissors

In these exercises it is important to use functions, putting the code inside them so you can call them afterwards. Here I send you some documentation about how the functions work. 

[W3 school - functions documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) 
[Real Python - function documentation](https://realpython.com/python-return-statement/#:~:text=The%20Python%20return%20statement%20is%20a%20special%20statement%20that%20you,can%20be%20any%20Python%20object.) 

In the exercise 8, you can put the gestures in a dictionary with all the combinations (the winning gesture as key and the losing gesture as value `{'rock': 'scissors'}`ans so on), and then use them to check the gestures. It would be a similar solution to what you did with the lists in the bonus. 

Again, this was a really good prework. Now enjoy this bootcamp and learn as much as possible 🚀
